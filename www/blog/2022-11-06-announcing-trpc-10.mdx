## Introduction

tRPC's mission from day one has been to provide you with an easy way of moving fast and not breaking nothing whilst building full-stack applications.

Since we released our last major version in August 2021, we've gotten over 13,500+ more stars on GitHub, a [Discord-community](https://trpc.io/discord) with over 2,000 members, thousands more applications built using tRPC, a growing ecosystem, and countless community members contributing and providing valuable feedback.

Today, **we're launching tRPC 10**. It is already used in production and can safely be used for in your next, or current, TypeScript project.

Get up and running with the [example applications](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/awesome-trpc#-starting-points-example-projects-etc) to get a feel of tRPC 10, or see the [guide for migrating from tRPC 9 to tRPC 10](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/migrate-from-v9-to-v10).

## Overview of changes

tRPC 10 is our biggest release ever. This is the first time we have made any fundamental changes to the structure of tRPC, yet these changes unlock new possibilities for cross-functional teams working on cutting-edge applications.

tRPC 10 includes:

- **Massively Improved TypeScript Performance:**
- **Improved API Experience**
  - Calling functions instead of invoking strings
  - CMD+clicking and refactoring from the frontend
  - Easier to infer types
- **Powerful Backend Framework**
  - Reusable middlewares
  - Reusable base procedures

### Massively Improved TypeScript Performance

TypeScript enables us to do very cool things, but it comes at a cost. Many of the things that we (ab)use in tRPC are excessive on the compiler, and as a result, you might have experienced your IDE slowing down as your application grows.

In v10, we've improved this massively by changing our API allows TypeScript to be much faster, especially during incremental compilation, allowing your IDE to remain snappy.

### Improved DX

tRPC 10 embraces TypeScript to its fullest potential to give you an unparalleled DX across the API.

You will notice the following in tRPC 10:

- Jump straight to your backend function from your frontend by just CMD+clicking the path
- Right click and _"Rename Symbol"_ to rename an input argument or a procedure name across your whole application.
- [Easier to infer types](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/infer-types)

### Powerful Backend Framework

We've doubled down on the core philosophy of making cross-functional teams more effective and enabling more developers to jump into the backend.

tRPC 10 creates an seamless experience between the front- and backend that further blurs the line between them

Other ways tRPC 10 provides a powerful backend framework:

- [Reusable middlewares](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/middlewares) with [Context Swapping](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/middlewares#context-swapping)
- [Reusable base procedures](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/procedures#reusable-base-publicprocedures) with [multiple input parsers](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/procedures#multiple-input-parsers)
- Flexible [error handling](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/error-handling) with custom [error formatting](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/error-formatting)
- [Procedure metadata](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/metadata) to decorate your procedures with more information

### Growing tRPC Ecosystem

A rich ecosystem is starting to take form around tRPC. Here are a few examples:

- [trpc-openapi](https://github.com/jlalmes/trpc-openapi) to easily create REST-compataible endpoints
- [create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) to botstrap a full-stack Next.js application with tRPC
- [create-t3-turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo) to kickstart your next React Native app with tRPC
- [trpc-chrome](https://github.com/jlalmes/trpc-chrome) for building Chrome extensions using tRPC
- There are adapters so you can use tRPC easily in Solid, Svelte, or Vue
- View more examples, plugins, & boilerplates in our [Awesome tRPC collection](https://trpc.io/docs/awesome-trpc)

### Incremental Migration Path

If you want to migrate incrementally, we've also put in a lot of work to make the experience as straightforward as possible for you, with almost full backward compatibility. See the [migration guide](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/migrate-from-v9-to-v10) for a full breakdown.

[Sachin](https://twitter.com/s4chinraja) from the tRPC team has also made [a codemod](https://github.com/sachinraja/trpc-v10-migrate-codemod) that will do much of the heavy lifting for you.

## Thank you!

We're just getting started & we're already busy experimenting with [React Server Components](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/229) & Next.js 13 and planning to do release some amazing tools to work with that very soon.

A huuuge shoutout goes out to [Sachin](https://twitter.com/s4chinraja), [Julius](https://twitter.com/jullerino), [James](https://twitter.com/jlalmes), [Ahmed](https://twitter.com/ixahmedxii), [Chris](https://twitter.com/trashh_dev), [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg), [..... TODO].

Thanks for using and supporting tRPC.
